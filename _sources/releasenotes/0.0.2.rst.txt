Bugfix: Degenerate Polygons and the Shapely Formatter
-----------------------------------------------------

The :func:`contours.core.shapely_formatter` could not handle single point
polygons or polygons with single point holes.  

* In the case of regular contours the :func:`shapely_formatter` now returns
  :class:`shapely.geometry.Point` objects for single point contour lines.  
* In the case of filled contours the :func:`shapely_formatter` now removes
  single point polygons and single point holes in polygons as they are not well
  defined for filled contours.
